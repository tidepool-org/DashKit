# Dash PumpManager

This is a Loop PumpManager implemention to provide support for the Omnipod DASH™ Pod.

While this implementation is open source, it depends on a private framework that is not openly available. Tidepool is providing the implementation as open source in the interests of transparency, even though this PumpManager cannot be built without the private framework.
